# CryptoClustering

This project uses unsupervised learning techniques including k-means clustering and PCA to predict changes cryptocurrencies.  

Methodology  
1-Create a dataframe for the crypto market data and use coin_id field as the index.  
2-Find best value for k using the elbow method then create scatter plot of k number of clusters.  
3-Find best value for k for PCA using the elbow method then create a scatter plot of k number of clusters.  
4-Compare the two scatter plots to determine if reducing the dimensionality of the data is beneficial to the accuracy of the output.
